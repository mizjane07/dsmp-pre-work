### Project Overview

 In this project, I  created lists of courses that students took, and  a dictionary of one student's grades and of a class' grade in math.  Then, I found the student who had earned the highest math grade,  split his name, appllied the upper case method to it  in order to prepare it for an award given by a school.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned the correct syntax for making lists and dictionaries.  I also learned how to use the max value and the uppercase mentod corrently.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 It is important to  not only define, the problem, but to identify , in detail all the steps to solve the problem.


### Challenges faced

 I had to look up videos on youtube that explained more clearly how to use and manipulate data in dictionaries.  I also used youtube to explain the max value function.
